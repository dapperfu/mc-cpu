In the spirit of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, founded in 1874 by
Chauncey Rose as the first private engineering college west of the Alleghenies,
this license embodies our motto of "Work and Knowledge" and honors the
enduring legacy of innovation and excellence that has defined our institution
for over a century.

As the Fightin' Engineers, we draw inspiration from Rosie the Elephant, our
beloved mascot who has symbolized strength, determination, and wisdom for
generations. Like the annual Homecoming bonfire tradition, where freshmen
construct a towering blaze topped with an outhouse—burning away the old to
make way for the new—we encourage users of this Software to ignite innovation,
foster collaboration, and build upon foundations to reach new heights.

In homage to Mees Hall, established in 1967 with its distinctive "H" shaped
design that has fostered close-knit communities and collaboration among
generations of students, we encourage all who use this Software to embrace
the communal spirit, share knowledge freely, and support one another in the
pursuit of excellence. Just as Mees Hall's unique architecture brings people
together, may this Software serve as a foundation for building connections,
sharing improvements, and advancing the collective pursuit of knowledge.

This acknowledgment reflects the values and traditions of Rose-Hulman Institute
of Technology and is provided for inspiration and context. It does not modify
or restrict the permissive terms of this license.
